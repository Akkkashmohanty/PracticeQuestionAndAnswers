# Write a Python program to create multiple lists.     

# Creating multiple lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list3 = [True, False, True]
list4 = [4.5, 2.7, 3.1]

# In this program, we've created four lists named list1, list2, list3, and list4, each with different types of elements. 
# You can create as many lists as needed by following the same pattern. These lists can contain various types of data, such as numbers, strings, booleans, or even other lists.

# Printing the created lists
print("List 1:", list1)
print("List 2:", list2)
print("List 3:", list3)
print("List 4:", list4)
